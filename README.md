# GameoGPT

Simple project for testing llm chains with open ai, very basic only spending about a day on research with streamlit and language models. So it is in a very rough state.

* Modify input data.
* Click generate.
* Wait for the response.
* Click download button if you want a txt to download with the response for further use.

## Todo
* Cache old results.
